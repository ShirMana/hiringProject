            <h2>Human Services</h2>
        </header>
        Human services is an interdisciplinary field of study with the objective of meeting human needs through an applied knowledge base, focusing on prevention as well as remediation of problems, and maintaining a commitment to improving the overall quality of life of service populations. The process involves the study of social technologies (practice methods, models, and theories), service technologies (programs, organizations, and systems), and scientific innovations designed to ameliorate problems and enhance the quality of life of individuals, families and communities to improve the delivery of service with better coordination, accessibility and accountability. The mission of human services is to promote a practice that involves simultaneously working at all levels of society (whole-person approach) in the process of promoting the autonomy of individuals or groups, making informal or formal human services systems more efficient and effective, and advocating for positive social change within society. <br>
        Human services practitioners strive to advance the autonomy of service users through civic engagement, education, health promotion and social change at all levels of society. Practitioners also engage in advocating so human systems remain accessible, integrated, efficient and effective. <br>
        Human services academic programs can be readily found in colleges and universities, which award degrees at the associate, baccalaureate, and graduate levels. Human services programs exist in countries all around the world.

            <h2>Manufacturing</h2>
        </header>
        Manufacturing is the production of products for use or sale, using labor and machines, tools, and chemical or biological processing or formulation. It is the essence of secondary industry. The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high-tech, but is most commonly applied to industrial design, in which raw materials from primary industry are transformed into finished goods on a large scale. Such goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other more complex products (such as aircraft, household appliances, furniture, sports equipment or automobiles), or distributed via the tertiary industry to end users and consumers (usually through wholesalers, who in turn sell to retailers, who then sell them to individual customers).

               <h3> Industrial Machinery Mechanics</h3>
            </header>
            <main>
                <p>Industrial machinery is production machinery. This means at least two things: First, the machine is located in a plant of some sort and, second, when it breaks down, getting it running again quickly is essential. A broken machine can stop an entire assembly line, costing a company a huge amount of money in lost production time. That's why industrial machinery mechanics are so vital. It's also why these professionals spend so much of their time doing preventative maintenance.</p> <p> Machine parts need to be oiled, greased, and cleaned on a regular basis. Robots and other automated equipment need to be calibrated. And often, diagnostic programs must be run. Indeed, given the increasing computerization of industrial machines, it can be important to be as good with a floppy disk and keyboard as with a socket wrench and micrometer.</p> <p>The work can be dirty and cramped. You may be called in from a sound night's sleep to make emergency repairs in the middle of the night. In fact, the U.S. Labor department reports that for more than half of all industrial machinery repairers, working overtime is common.</p> <p>This can be a very well paid job - and no wonder: If the machines don't work, then the factory doesn't work. That makes a company's industrial machinery mechanics very important people indeed.</p>
